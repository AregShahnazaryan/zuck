        I know, I know. It's supposed to be about "us", not "we". But we're always ready to break a rule or two,
        especially
        when it comes to we.
        We are Zuck&Berg. Zuck for short. And we are all about we. In fact, I'll type WE in all caps from here on, to
        show
        just how much WE
        value "WE". WE value WE as much as Zuck values Berg, Hewlett values Packard and Procter values Gamble.
        <br><br>
        Ideas and solutions appear, when WE get together and start sharing. The first time WE got together and shared,
        Zuck&Berg was
        born to reflect the meaning of WE. That this is what WE'd call WE wasn't questioned for a second. But now,
        every new meeting
        starts with a discussion of our name. It's been more than two years since WE first surprised people, and from
        that very moment WE
        decided that the surprises would never cease.
