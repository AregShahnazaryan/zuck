        Before going forward to the mission of Z-Generation (Gen Z), hereâ€™s a little about its origin. Gen Z is a
        demographic group born between 1995 and 2005. According to numerous statistics, in 2025 they will make up the
        majority of the consumer population - about 85%. Today, many brands from around the world are developing their
        strategy in such a way as to please Gen Z.

        It's worth mentioning that Gen Z is committed to globalization. They are against all kinds of discrimination,
        care about the environment (as evidenced by the many protests and movements) and are generally more active on
        social networks. But that doesn't mean they depend on social media. On the contrary, they use the Internet for
        self-education, money-making and, finally, for self-expression and raising problems.

        Gen Z aims to work at an early age in order not to be financially dependent on parents. There are also Gen Z
        representatives in Weee - about 30%, and many projects are assigned to them from the first stage of idea
        creation and development. Gen Z has its unique worldview and an ability to comment on any phenomenon, which
        helps them effectively achieve the desired results.

        As for the themes and content in general, they value the real and the minimal. No exaggeration, no
        artificiality. Moreover, if the ad contains storytelling, it will get a high rating from Gen Z. Also, it is
        crucial to mention cases of social responsibility. There is a tendency towards sincerity. Big brands build their
        content with more natural lifestyle techniques, which is valued by Gen Z.

        Gen Z doesn't want to talk about changing the world, they're going to do it. What is left? To conquer their
        hearts with relevant communications...
